Ibrahim questioned his people: 'Do you worship what you yourselves carve, while Allah created you and what you make?' One day, when the people left to attend a festival, Ibrahim entered their temple. He saw food placed before the idols as offerings. He mockingly asked them, 'Will you not eat? What is the matter with you that you do not speak?' Then, he smashed all the idols except the largest one, placing the axe in its hand. When the people returned and saw what had happened, they were furious. They questioned Ibrahim, who cleverly replied, 'Rather, this largest one did it, so ask them if they can speak!' The people realized their folly, admitting, 'You know well that these do not speak!' Ibrahim then declared, 'Then do you worship besides Allah that which does not benefit you at all, nor harm you? Uff to you and to what you worship besides Allah! Will you not use reason?'",

Despite the hardships he faced, including false imprisonment, Yusuf remained patient and faithful to Allah. His ability to interpret dreams eventually brought him before the king, and he was appointed as a minister to manage Egypt's resources during a famine. Years later, when his brothers came to Egypt seeking food during the famine, they did not recognize Yusuf, who was now a powerful leader.

During their journey, Al-Khidr did three seemingly wrong things: he damaged a boat belonging to poor people, killed a young boy, and rebuilt a wall in a town whose people had refused them hospitality. Each time, Musa couldn't help but question these actions. Finally, Al-Khidr explained: he damaged the boat to save it from a tyrannical king who was seizing every boat by force; he killed the boy because he would have caused his righteous parents grief and disbelief; and he rebuilt the wall because beneath it was a treasure belonging to two orphan boys, and their father was righteous, so Allah wanted them to reach maturity and retrieve their treasure.",

The Prophet (peace be upon him) calmly replied, 'What do you think of two, when Allah is the third with them? Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.' Allah protected them, and the pursuers left without finding them.

When Umar asked what she was doing, she explained that she had nothing to feed her children, so she was boiling water to make them think food was being prepared, hoping they would fall asleep from exhaustion. She said bitterly, 'May Allah judge between me and Umar for neglecting us!' Not revealing his identity, Umar immediately went to the treasury, carried a sack of flour and meat on his own shoulders, and brought it to the woman. He then cooked food for the children himself until they were satisfied and fell asleep peacefully. The woman prayed for the kind stranger, saying, 'May Allah reward you!

Despite the excruciating pain, Bilal would only say 'Ahad, Ahad' (One, One), affirming the oneness of Allah and refusing to worship the idols. Abu Bakr eventually purchased Bilal's freedom. Due to his beautiful voice and his unwavering faith, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) chose Bilal to be the first muezzin (caller to prayer) in Islam.

She gave each daughter a date and was about to eat the third herself when both daughters looked at her longingly, wanting more. The mother's heart melted with compassion. Instead of eating the date herself, she split it in half and gave each daughter a portion, keeping nothing for herself despite her own hunger.

Still seeking forgiveness, he asked again about the most learned person and was directed to a scholar. He asked the scholar if Allah could forgive him for killing one hundred people. The scholar replied, 'Yes, and who can stand between you and repentance? Go to such-and-such land where there are people who worship Allah. Worship Allah with them and do not return to your land, for it is an evil place.' The man set off, but died halfway through his journey. The angels of mercy and the angels of punishment disputed over his soul. Allah commanded that they measure the distance between the two lands. Whichever was closer would determine his fate. They found he was closer by a hand span to the land he was traveling toward. The angels of mercy took his soul.",

Then he ascended through the seven heavens, meeting prophets including Adam, Yahya, Isa, Yusuf, Idris, Harun, Musa, and finally Ibrahim. He was taken to the highest point where he received the command for the five daily prayers directly from Allah. Originally fifty prayers were prescribed, but through Prophet Musa's advice, Muhammad repeatedly returned to ask for reduction until it was established at five prayers with the reward of fifty. He was shown Paradise and Hell and witnessed many of the signs of Allah's majesty. He returned to Makkah the same night, and when he told the Quraysh about this journey, many mocked him.

The Quraysh leaders gathered, expecting severe punishment for their years of persecution, torture, and murder of Muslims. Instead, the Prophet asked them, 'What do you think I will do with you?' They replied, 'You are a noble brother, son of a noble brother.' The Prophet then declared words that would echo through history: 'This day no reproach shall be on you.

An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor does a non-Arab have any superiority over an Arab; a white person has no superiority over a black person, nor does a black person have any superiority over a white person, except by piety and good action.' He emphasized the sanctity of life, property, and honor, saying they are as sacred as this day, in this month, in this city. He stressed the rights of women, urging men to treat their wives with kindness. He emphasized the importance of maintaining family ties and warned against usury and revenge killings. He reminded them that they would meet their Lord who would question them about their deeds. After each major point, he would ask, 'Have I conveyed the message?' and the massive crowd would respond, 'Yes!' He would then say, 'O Allah, bear witness!' He concluded by saying, 'I leave behind me two things, the Quran and my Sunnah, and if you follow these you will never go astray.'

On another occasion, while delivering a sermon, he saw his grandsons walking and stumbling in their long garments. He immediately stopped his sermon, came down from the pulpit, picked them up, and brought them up with him. He explained, 'Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth when they said that your wealth and children are a trial, for I saw these two walking and stumbling and I could not bear to continue until I picked them up.'

He then asked for a bucket of water to be poured over the spot to clean it. The Bedouin was so moved by the Prophet's gentle treatment that he later said, 'May Allah have mercy on me and Muhammad, and may He not have mercy on anyone else!' The Prophet smiled at this and said, 'You have restricted something vast,' meaning that Allah's mercy is vast and encompasses all of creation. On another occasion, a Bedouin pulled the Prophet roughly by his cloak, leaving a red mark on his neck, and demanded harshly, 'Give me from Allah's wealth that you have!' Instead of reacting with anger, the Prophet smiled and ordered that the man be given a gift.",
    "lesson": "These incidents exemplify the Prophet's infinite patience, wisdom, and mercy in dealing with people, especially those who lacked knowledge or manners. He chose education over punishment, gentleness over harshness. He understood that harsh treatment would have driven the Bedouin away from Islam, while kindness and proper explanation would open his heart. This teaches us to respond to ignorance with knowledge, to rudeness with gentleness, and to mistakes with mercy and guidance. The Prophet's example shows that true strength lies in controlling one's anger and responding to negativity with positivity.",
