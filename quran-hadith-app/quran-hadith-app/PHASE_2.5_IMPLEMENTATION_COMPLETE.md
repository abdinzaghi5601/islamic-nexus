**Date Completed:** October 13, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Implemented & Built

---

## Overview

Phase 2.5 completes the user experience features begun in Phase 2, adding comprehensive reading progress tracking, an achievement system, additional bookmark types, and enhanced dashboard functionality. Users can now track their reading streaks, unlock achievements, bookmark hadiths and duas, and view all their bookmarks in a dedicated management page.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Reading Progress Tracking

#### Reading History API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/reading-history`
- **Methods**:
  - **POST**: Record when a user reads an ayah
    - Deduplication: Prevents duplicate records within 5 minutes
    - Body: `{ userId: string, ayahId: string }`
    - Returns reading history entry with ayah details

  - **GET**: Retrieve user's reading history
    - Returns last 50 reads with full ayah and surah details
    - Ordered by most recent first

#### Reading Statistics API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/reading-history/stats`
- **Method**: GET
- **Returns**:
  ```typescript
  {
    streak: number,              // Consecutive days with reading
    todayReads: number,          // Total reads today
    todayUniqueAyahs: number,    // Unique ayahs read today
    totalUniqueAyahs: number,    // All-time unique ayahs read
    weeklyReads: number          // Reads in last 7 days
  }
  ```

#### Automatic Tracking
- Integrated into Quran reader (`SurahDisplay` component)
- Tracks first 3 ayahs of each surah view

## Database Queries & Performance

### Optimizations Implemented

1. **Parallel Queries**:
   - Dashboard fetches 3 endpoints simultaneously
   - Achievements API uses `Promise.all()` for 5 database queries
   - Reduces total wait time from sum to maximum

2. **Deduplication**:
   - Reading history prevents duplicate entries within 5 minutes
   - Reduces database bloat
   - Improves query performance

3. **Distinct Queries**:
   - Uses Prisma's `distinct` for unique ayah counts
   - Efficient for statistics calculation
   - Avoids manual deduplication in code

4. **Limited Results**:
   - Reading history limited to 50 most recent
   - Dashboard bookmarks limited to 5 most recent
   - Prevents large data transfers

5. **Indexed Fields**:
   - Bookmarks have `userId` index
   - Reading history has `userId` index
   - Compound unique indexes on bookmark tables
   - Improves query speed

### Streak Calculation Algorithm

```typescript
function calculateStreak(userId):
  today = startOfDay(new Date())
  streak = 0
  currentDate = today

  while streak < 365:
    nextDay = currentDate + 1 day
    hasRead = count reads between currentDate and nextDay

    if hasRead > 0:
      streak++
      currentDate = currentDate - 1 day
    else:
      break

  return streak
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = streak length (max 365)
**Optimization Opportunity**: Cache streak value, recalculate daily

# http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

### 2. Test Reading Streak

```bash
# Day 1: Read any ayah
# Check dashboard - "Reading Streak" should show "1 day"

# Day 2: Read any ayah
# Check dashboard - "Reading Streak" should show "2 days"

# Skip a day
# Check dashboard - Streak resets to 0
```

### 3. Test Achievements

```bash
# Bookmark your first ayah
# Navigate to dashboard
# Check "Achievements" section
# Should see "Bookworm" achievement (❤️ Bronze)

# Try deleting a bookmark
# Verify it's removed from list
```

### 5. Test Daily Goals

## Performance Metrics

### Dashboard Load Time
- **Before Phase 2.5**: 1 API call (dashboard stats)
- **After Phase 2.5**: 3 parallel API calls
- **Overhead**: ~50-100ms (negligible with Promise.all)
- **Data Richness**: Significantly improved

### Reading History Tracking
- **Delay**: 2 seconds after page load
- **Non-blocking**: Doesn't affect page render
- **Deduplication**: Prevents excessive database writes
- **Batch**: Tracks 3 ayahs per surah view

### Streak Calculation
- **Worst Case**: 365 days (100-day streak cap)
- **Average**: 1-30 days
- **Optimization**: Could be cached with daily recalculation

---

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements
